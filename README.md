# Audience overlapper
A simple little SPA to visualize audience overlap.
## Getting started
 - git clone this repo.
 - make sure you have python3.6 (i use f"" strings because they are awesome so deal with it) with everything in requirements.txt installed.
 - create a folder called "credentials" under the audienceoverlap folder (next to the oython code).
 - copy your google.json/facebook.json credentials file/s (depending which you plan to use ) into the credentials folder.
 - run the app script "bash run_server.sh".
 - go to localhost:5006/audienceoverlap in your browser.
 - Report all the bugs you find.
